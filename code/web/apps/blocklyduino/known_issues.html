        <h1>Known Issues</h1>
        <ul>
            <li> Supported Browsers
                <ul>
                    <li> Firefox 29+ (Tested on Windows)
                    <li> Chrome 39+ (Tested on Windows, Android, and ChromeOS)
                    <li> Safari XX (Tested on Mac OSX 10.8)
                    <li> Internet Explorer 11+ (see note)
                </ul>
            <li> Internet Explorer is broken. - almost works on IE,
                but there are some major usability issues.
            <li> Functions the return values. - the resulting code will have errors
            <li> Local variables - All variables defined in your code (except for function parameters)
                are currently global variables. There are plans to support locally declared variables eventually.
            <li> No support for floating point types. We would like to support them eventually.
            <li> There are currently limited(no) options for converting numbers to text.
            <li> The user interface can be difficult to use on mobile devices, we want to fix that eventually.
        </ul>
